The Houthis (Ansar Allah) on April 11 carried out another drone attack against Israel, despite an uptake in United States strikes on Yemen.

Two Yafa drones were launched at “military targets” close to the central Israeli city of Tel Aviv, Houthi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree said in a statement, noting that the attack was carried out “in support of the oppressed Palestinian people and their dear Mujahideen, and in response to the ongoing war of genocide against our brothers in Gaza.”

Separately, the Jordanian Armed Forces said that a drone “of an unknown origin” infiltrated the Kingdom’s airspace and crashed in the western province of Madaba, near the Dead Sea. Video footage posted to social networks showed fire at the crash site.

Bohdan Krotevych, a notorious former Ukrainian commander and ex-chief of staff of the far-right Azov Brigade, has publicly called for the removal of General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s armed forces commander, accusing him of endangering soldiers’ lives with “borderline criminal” orders and outdated tactics, the Guardian reports.

Krotevych, who resigned in February (allegedly to speak freely), criticized Syrskyi for micromanaging the military and issuing directives that force troops to rest dangerously close to the front lines, such as 50 meters away, rather than in safer rear areas. He argues that Syrskyi’s lack of strategic innovation—relying on throwing more troops into battles or withdrawing them only when overwhelmed—has contributed to Ukraine’s losses in 2024 and 2025...

The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) has reportedly upgraded its aging French-made Dassault Mirage F1 fighter jets.

Iran seized 24 F1BQs and F1EQs which flew over from Iraq during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The fighter jets received multiple local upgrades in later years. As of 2021, 12 Mirage F1EQs and five Mirage F1BQs were reported to be in service with the IRIAF.

Last month, a video posted to social media showed one of the IRIAF upgraded Mirage F1 taking off. The footage was likely shot at Chahbahar Air Base, the home of fighter jets of this type.

The Houthis (Ansar Allah) announced on April 9 that they had carried out several drone attacks, targeting Israel and warships of the United States Navy in response to the war on the Gaza Strip and recent strikes on Yemen.

Overnight, more than 20 U.S. strikes hit Houthi-controlled areas. In the western province of al-Hodeidah, 12 people, including four children and six women, were killed when a strike hit a residential area in the Hawak District, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.

Amid the deadly strikes, the Houthis managed to shoot down another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper combat drone over the northern province of Al-Jawf. Footage showing the wreckage of the drone was released later by the group.

In a post on the X stoical network, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, Colonel Avichay Adraee, said that the weapons site, located under residential buildings and next to a school, was bombed by Israel last November, days before a United States-brokered ceasefire entered into effect.

Israel escalated in the last few weeks, launching two strikes against targets of Hezbollah in Beirut, on March 27 and April 1 in response to rocket attacks which the group denied responsibility for.

Against the backdrop of the failure in Syria and the beginning of popular protests against the Ak Parti and MHP regime, Erdogan suffered another defeat. A number of Turkic countries in Central Asia sent their ambassadors to the Republic of Cyprus and thereby ruled out the process of recognizing the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”.

Thus, the efforts of the Turkish establishment to recognize an independent republic in northern Cyprus are gradually fading. It is worth noting here that the Turkish opposition, represented by the CHP, regularly criticized the approach of the ruling party and their nationalist allies to the Cyprus issue, which ultimately resulted in the loss of allies among the Turkic states on this issue. For Erdogan, the Turkish Cypriots are just a weapon in a geopolitical game where control over the hydrocarbons of the Mediterranean is at stake.

On April 1, 2025, the Telegraph reported that Donald Trump had approved the deal to transfer Chagos to Mauritius. According to the newspaper’s sources, the Americans have secured changes to the treaty. It is not yet possible to say exactly what the changes will be. However, given the example of the recent text of the agreement on rare earth metals with Ukraine, it can be assumed that the White House was not particularly shy about the wording. 

For the U.S., any Chinese penetration of a strategically important region is unacceptable. It is possible that a “cap” will be placed on Chinese investment in Port Louis and that economic cooperation with Beijing will be limited. The UK has already promised to invest £18 billion in the Mauritian economy for the Diego Garcia lease.

The most recent incident occurred near the village of Demidovka, where Russian forces destroyed an abandoned Abrams and an accompanying armored recovery vehicle (ARV), footage of which circulated widely on Russian military channels.

Fighters of the brigade , which is led by Ahmad al-Awda, were accused last week of killing Ahmed al-Daroubi, a former member of the faction who recently joined government forces. After a round of clashes, the command of the brigade accepted an agreement that saw the deployment of the General Security Service (GSS) in its stronghold, the town of Busra in the eastern Daraa countryside.

Shortly after the announcement, it was reported that the GSS had taken over all of the factions’ military and security sites in Busra, including two prisons.

Iran continues to bolster its air defense network amid high tensions with the United States and Israel over its nuclear program.

Video footage posted to social networks on April 13 revealed the redeployment of several air defense systems in an unidentified part of the country. Two Sevom Khordad transporter erector launcher and radar (TELR), one Tabas TELR and an unidentified radar can be seen in the footage.

The Sevom Khordad and Tabas are made in Iran. They are mainly armed with the local Taer 2 anti-aircraft radar-guided missile that has a range of 50 kilometers.

**Syria’s Islamist-led interim government imposed late on April 12 a curfew in the town of Busra in the eastern Daraa countryside following tensions with a powerful armed faction.**

The tensions began on April 10 when clashes broke out in Busra between the General Security Service (GSS) and local fighters led by Ahmad al-Awda over an attack on Ahmed al-Daroubi, a former member of the faction who recently joined government forces.

On April 13, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that two local fighters who attacked al-Daroubi were handed over to the GSS. The force also carried out a series of raids in Busra to seize weapons, but nothing was found, according to the London-based monitoring group.

Most military sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon have been placed under the control of the Lebanese military, a source close to the group told AFP on April 12.

The withdrawal of Hezbollah from southern Lebanon was one of the main terms of the United States-brokered ceasefire that ended the confrontation with Israel last November. Under the agreement, only United Nations peacekeepers and the Lebanese military should be deployed in the country’s south.

According to the ceasefire agreement, which entered into effect on November 27, Israel was supposed to withdraw from southern Lebanon by February 18. However, the IDF is still present at five strategic posts close to Israel’s border. The military also continues to launch strikes against Hezbollah, citing alleged threats to Israel’s security.

Forces from the Russian military group in Syria are still operating at Qamishli International Airport in the northeast of the country, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported on April 12.

Amid the collapse of the Assad regime last December, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is backed by the United States, took over the airport. However, Russian forces stayed there. Later, reports emerged that Israeli strikes targeted weapons left by the former Syrian Arab Army at the airport.

In a report released last February, the SOHR described the Russian military deployed at Qamishli as “massive” and said that Russian forces were also present at two posts out the airport.

The Russian military has reportedly shot down yet another American-made F-16 fighter jet of the Ukrainian Air Force (UAF).

In a statement released on April 12, the UAF mourned the F-16 pilot 26-year-old Pavlo Ivanov, but stopped short from acknowledging that the fighter jet was shot down by Russian fire.

While Ukrainian media largely described the aerial losses as a “crash,” the BBC, citing a Ukrainian military source, reported that the F-16 fell on April 11 after being hit by a Russian anti-aircraft missile.

Ukraine received the first batch of F-16s just last July. Ten such fighter jets have so far been delivered to the country out of a total of 85 pledged by Belgium, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. At least three of the jets have been already confirmed to be destroyed.

Syria’s Islamist-led interim government on April 12 deployed its forces around a strategic dam in northern Syria, under a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

The official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported “the entry of Syrian Arab Army forces and security forces into the Tishrin Dam … to impose security in the region, under the agreement reached with the SDF”.

The deal also calls for a joint military force to protect the dam, and for the withdrawal of Turkey-backed factions “that seek to disrupt this agreement”, according to the SANA.

What appears to be U.S. military vehicles can be seen in video footage allegedly showing the deployment of government forces near Tishrin Dam. This indicates that the coalition is playing a key role in the deal between the interim government and the SDF.

The bold push completely isolated the area of Rafah, which lies along Gaza’s border with Egypt, from the city of Khan Younis.

The IDF said in a brief statement that it has eliminated dozens of Palestinian fighters and destroyed Hamas infrastructure, including tunnels, while operating in the corridor over the past week and a half.
